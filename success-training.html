  <h2>Your Training Blueprint Is Now In The Queue.</h2>

  <p>Before anything gets built, I need your details.</p>

  <a class="cta-button" href="https://forms.gle/MWGBVenPXqhjjRYx5">
    Complete Your Training Intake Form
  </a>

  <p style="margin-top: 18px;">
    Take your time and answer honestly. The more specific you are, the better your plan will fit your real life.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 8px;">
    Most plans are delivered within <strong>3–5 business days</strong> after your intake is submitted.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 14px; font-size: 0.85rem; opacity: 0.8;">
    No intake form = no plan. You’re responsible for filling it out.
