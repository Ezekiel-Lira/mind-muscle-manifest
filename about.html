    <h3>Mind Muscle Manifest:
      Who It Is For</h3>
    <p class="subtext">
      This is for people who are tired of almost committing. If you want a clear plan, clear standards, and zero hand-holding, you’re in the right place.
      If you want someone to tell you it’s okay to stay the same, this is not for you.

        <h4>Who You Are</h4>
        <p>You train or want to train seriously. You’re tired of random workouts and “kind of” tracking your food.</p>
        <p>You want a stronger, leaner, more capable body that actually matches how you see yourself.</p>

        <div class="label">Me</div>
        <h4>What I Do</h4>
        <p>I take your goals, schedule, and equipment and turn them into a structured plan you can’t hide from.</p>
        <p>No fluff. No recycled templates. Just training and nutrition that makes sense and demands effort.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="label">The Deal</div>
        <h4>How This Works</h4>
        <p>You bring honesty and effort. I bring clarity and structure. If you execute, your body changes.</p>
        <p>If you don’t, that’s on you. The plan won’t be the weak link.</p>
